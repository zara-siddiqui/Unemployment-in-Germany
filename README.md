# Motivation
As the author of this project, my motivation stems from my academic background and previous research experience. Having completed my master's thesis on unemployment in the banking industry in Pakistan, I developed a keen interest in understanding and analyzing unemployment dynamics within different economic contexts.

Driven by curiosity, I embarked on this project to delve into the unemployment situation in Germany, particularly during the challenging times brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. My aim is to shed light on how the employment landscape has evolved.
